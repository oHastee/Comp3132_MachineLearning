# COMP3132 Machine Learning - Weekly Progress

This repository contains my work for the COMP3132 Machine Learning course. Each week, I will document my progress, key takeaways, and any new technologies or datasets I explore during the labs.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1
**Accomplishments:**
- Completed my first lab in COMP3132.
- Explored the basics of machine learning and set up my development environment.
- Worked with Jupyter Notebook for executing Python-based ML experiments.
- Configured Google Colab for GPU acceleration.
- Installed essential libraries (`python-dotenv`, `jupyter_bokeh`).
- Explored online chatbot interaction via `together.ai`.
- Studied the difference between Base and Chat models.
- Learned how to make API calls to an LLM model.

**Key Learnings:**
- Introduction to machine learning concepts and applications.
- Understanding the structure of Jupyter Notebooks.
- Basic data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.
- The importance of GPU acceleration in ML workflows.
- Differences between `base` and `instruction-tuned` models.
- How to interact with an LLM chatbot programmatically.

**New Technologies/Datasets Used:**
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Google Colab (T4 GPU runtime)
- Together.ai API
